# Simple Music Advisor App
Java desktop application that access Spotify API and show requested information.
Application is able to:
- authenticate against Spotify API using OAuth protocol,
- show a list of new albums with artists and links on Spotify,
- show list of Spotify-featured playlists with their links fetched from API,
- show a list of all available categories on Spotify (just their names), and
- show playlists, grouped by the category names, with their links fetched from API.

# Technology
- Java 11
- Maven 3.6.3

# Create Spotify App
To be able to authenticate against Spotify API first we must go to the [Spotify Web site for developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create our application. We can give it arbitrary name and description and put our localhost address as redirect URI: "http://localhost:8080". We must use exactly this URL and port because our Music Advisor app depends on it.

# To run application:
To compile and build, navigate to the project root directory and run following command:
> mvn clean package

After we have successfully built the project, we can run application with the following command:
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="advisor.Main"

# Examples
The symbol **>** represents the user input.

**Example 1:** Authentication step <br>
To authenticate against Spotify API first we have to type **auth** command. <br>
After we get authentication link, application will wait till we do manual click on it and approve access to our Spotify App (the one that is created in the previous step).
```
